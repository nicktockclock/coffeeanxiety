# coffeeanxiety
This was a project created for an Intro to Game Design course at UTS. The idea we had was to create a game where the "bad guy" is the characters own anxiety.<br>
The game can be run in Unity, but is also running on itch.io here https://2linescrossed.itch.io/spill-the-beans <br>
Bear in mind the resolution can sometimes mess up the game on it's itch.io page.<br>
Use WASD to move around.<br>
For this project I worked as the main programmer and did the majority of the scripting using C#. chaoszeroomega worked as a producer and sourced the music assets, and all of the art assets were created by the very talented alxbrand.
